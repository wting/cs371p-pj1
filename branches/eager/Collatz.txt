If the UVA run time is different than the time stated in our blog entries, it's because assertions slow down the program and were commented out for submission.

I attest to having written every line of code and I take full
responsibility for the origin of all the code I turn in.

In particular if any of the code was originally written in a previous
semester I will so acknowledge in this document.
